# encryption-decryption
Here you can encrypt-decrypt strings in C++. The usage is very basic, you only need to provide the string you want to encrypt, and you'll get the clipher back encoded in base64 given that you provided a password, or a secret string. Also you can perform the alternate, which is decrypting the clipher, given that you have the password with which you have encrypted the latter string.
